# Final-Project: Homestead Road to self-sufficiency and Automation.

This research based and in part practical two part project is set out to fulfill several objectives. 
The first part of the project is research based and aims to outline in detail homestead's road to energy self-sufficiency with output and saving calculations based on actual consumption and location of the homestead.
The second part of the project applies physical computing to implement home automation for efficient energy resource management using an open source home automation software called Home Assistant. For demonstration purposes a custom built model is used to illustrate the application and implementation of home automation part of the project.
